# WeatherPy
The creation of the APP for my vacation trip from Elizabeth City, NC to Lubbock, TX was really challanaing and also at the same time fun. I could experience the usefulness of Open Weather Map APPs, and Google APPs. Now I know that I can create itinerary for any global travel by any mode of transport.
At the same time I found that this module was the hardest to complete. 
I also learned how to protect my various importan API Keys from making them public.
